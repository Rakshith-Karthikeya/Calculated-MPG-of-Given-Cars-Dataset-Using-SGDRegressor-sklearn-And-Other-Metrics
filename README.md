Predicting Car MPG

Car MPG dataset: 
The dataset consists of 393 car models, their attributes and their MPG. The columns in the data set are as follows: 
1. Car Model Name 
2. MPG - Miles Per Gallon. This is the value that we want to predict 
3. Number of cylinders 
4. Engine Displacement 
5. Engine Horse Power 
6. Car Weight 
7. Acceleration (time needed to reach a speed of 60 miles/hour) 
8. Model Year 
9. Origin
